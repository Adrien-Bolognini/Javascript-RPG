
            Project goal :

            Main idea of the project is learning how to use the Javascript code and implement & adapt & learn along with it.
            Inspiration are taken from old RPG GBC games and older such as the likes of PokÃ©mon, Final Fantasy, Earthbound, 
            Dragon Quest ect.

            Final goals : 

            * Make the RPG work on tiles of 16px each 
            * Only allowing moving by tiles in the overworld
            * Being able to load an overworld after reaching a certain point on another
            * Manage object and layers to create a world
            * Trying to animate tiles like water & flowers ect
            * Enter battles & create a system to go along with it
            * Create events and dialogues
            * Add & manage NPC's 
            * Make camera
            * Change control of characters or control more at once (party follow)
            * Event & cutscenes
            * Sound effect
            * Battle UI & state
            * Battle enemy & rewards
            * Battle management
            * shop & currencies & counter


            Current issues :

            * Animating tiles on a map currently rendered
            * Making tilesheets & map designs (design issue not related to code)
            * Text messages functions fail to properly work (code error)
            
            Features missing for the delivery by lack of time :

            * Anything related to battle state is missing
            * sprites & tilesheets are taken online by lack of time to make proper one (also not graded by those so focus 
            was on JS)


            Current issues :
            1 / Increasing the deph of the event & cutscenes => need to employ UI's or loops of behaviors
            2 / Designing tilesheets and maps prove to take much longer than expected to give out a proper & uniform style.
            3 / Animating a tile prove to be harder than expected, might require to be coded as an NPC and make an idle 
            animation


            Goals reached :

            * Make the RPG work on tiles of 16px each
            * Only allowing moving by tiles in the overworld
            * Manage object and layers to create a world
            * Add & manage NPC's
            * Make a camera
            * Change control of characters or control more at once (party follow)
            * Colliders & updating Colliders
            * rough basics of events & cutscenes
